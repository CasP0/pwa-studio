## Features
This extension brings the features of [pwabuilder.com](https://pwabuilder.com/) to VSCode!

- Improve your PWA with our snippets!

## Getting Started
- [Install the extension from the VSCode Marketplace](    https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemsitemName=pwa-builder.vscode-pwa-builder)

The quickest way to get started with the extension is by opening the PWABuilder panel. This can be done by clicking the PWABuilder icon on the left side of VSCode:

You should then see our three sections: Web Manifest, Service Worker, and your Store Ready Checklist. All three views have the top item checked off, then your PWA is ready to go:

If you are missing one of the items, no problem! The extension will provide you with a button to generate the needed asset:
