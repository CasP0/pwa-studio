## Getting Started
- [Install the extension from the VSCode Marketplace](    https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemsitemName=pwa-builder.vscode-pwa-builder)

The quickest way to get started with the extension is by opening the PWABuilder panel. This can be done by clicking the PWABuilder icon on the left side of VSCode:

You should then see our three sections: Web Manifest, Service Worker, and your Store Ready Checklist. All three views have the top item checked off, then your PWA is ready to go:
