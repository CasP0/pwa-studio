# pwabuilder-vscode

*Note: This is under heavy development*

Please use our [main repository for any issues/bugs/features suggestion](https://github.com/pwa-builder/PWABuilder/issues/new/choose).

## What, Why and How?

Why -
We currently offer tooling for building and packaging PWAs through a website, https://pwabuilder.com, however we want to meet developers where they are when working on their app, which for a large majority of developers is in VSCode.

What - 
A VSCode extension

How- 
This project should allow developers to:
- Start building a new Progressive Web App right from within VSCode
- Add the necessary technical pieces needed to be a PWA to an existing web app, in a best practices focused way
- Allow developers to test their PWA to ensure it is store ready and installable from the browser
- Package their app for the Microsoft Store and Google Play
- Snippits for capabilities that enhance the UX of a PWA

Stretch Goal: Can we give developers feedback on the UX of their app in some automated way through the extension?
